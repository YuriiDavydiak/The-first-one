I've taken my bows and my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses, no pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
That I ain't gonna lose
 
And I need to go on and on and on and on

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting, till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the world
